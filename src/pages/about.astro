    <p>Hi, I’m Maan. I’m someone who enjoys thoughtful storytelling, whether it comes from comics, manga, films, or games. I’ve always been drawn to creative worlds and the ideas behind them — not just how they're made, but why they resonate with people.</p>

    <p>I’ve lived in several countries, and that experience has shaped my perspective — I adapt quickly, stay curious, and value open-minded conversations. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching character-driven dramas or animation, and diving into games that offer more than just action — ones that tell a story or challenge the way you think.</p>

    <p>Outside of entertainment, I like to organise and improve things. Whether that’s setting up my home server, building tools, or just refining a small personal project, I find satisfaction in making systems work better. I enjoy learning new skills, but I also value quiet time to reflect or explore new ideas at my own pace.</p>
