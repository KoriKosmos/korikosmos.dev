    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">With a strong foundation in computer science and particular interests in artificial intelligence, systems, and design-focused technologies, I approach challenges with curiosity, structure, and a systems mindset. My experience spans low-level programming, cybersecurity, and application development, shaped by academic study and personal exploration.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">I’m especially comfortable learning on the go and adapting quickly to new tools, environments, and workflows. I thrive in spaces that challenge me or align with my interests, especially those that value independent thought and flexibility over rigid structure.</p>
    <p class="mb-2">Inspired early by building PCs and modding devices, I’ve always found energy in the hands-on nature of computing. My long-term goals include contributing to impactful software and AI projects while building toward a future in game development — a field where design, interactivity, and problem-solving intersect.</p>
    <p>Having lived in Pakistan, Indonesia, Wales, and England, I bring a global outlook and confidence working in multicultural environments. Outside of computing, I draw creative inspiration from comics and narrative media, often carrying those influences into my design thinking.</p>
