        "With a strong foundation in computer science and particular interests in artificial intelligence, systems, and design-focused technologies, I approach challenges with curiosity, structure, and a systems mindset. My experience spans low-level programming, cybersecurity, and application development, shaped by academic study and personal exploration.",
        "I’m especially comfortable learning on the go and adapting quickly to new tools, environments, and workflows. I thrive in spaces that challenge me or align with my interests, especially those that value independent thought and flexibility over rigid structure.",
        "Inspired early by building PCs and modding devices, I’ve always found energy in the hands-on nature of computing. My long-term goals include contributing to impactful software and AI projects while building toward a future in game development — a field where design, interactivity, and problem-solving intersect.",
        "Having lived in Pakistan, Indonesia, Wales, and England, I bring a global outlook and confidence working in multicultural environments. Outside of computing, I draw creative inspiration from comics and narrative media, often carrying those influences into my design thinking."
